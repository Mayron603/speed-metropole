## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong, authoritative blue (#2962FF) to convey trust and security. This hue is inspired by law enforcement uniforms, but has been brightened to avoid negative associations.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4FF) to provide a clean, modern backdrop without being stark white.  The background color remains closely aligned to the primary, so it reinforces authority, while creating greater visual contrast.
- Accent color: A vibrant violet (#7F39FF) is employed for highlights, interactive elements, and calls to action; the purposeful choice creates distinction from the primary and adds sophistication to the overall visual identity.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Inter' brings a machined, contemporary look for large text, while 'PT Sans' adds approachability for continuous reading.
- Use modern, minimalist icons that reflect the technological aspect of the SPEED unit.
- Clean, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy to ensure easy navigation and information access.
- Subtle, modern animations for transitions and interactive elements to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
